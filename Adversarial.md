# h1 Adversarial mindset: x) Read and summarize. 
Many organizations still rely on technologies and processes designed to combat risks posed by automated viruses and worms, which are insufficient to protect against targeted and manually directed APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attacks. An intelligence-based defense is therefore essential to build resilience against advanced threats. Intelligence-driven Cyber Network Defense (CND) is a risk management strategy focused on threat mitigation by analyzing the adversary’s capabilities, objectives, doctrines, and limitations. The result of intelligence-driven CND is a more resilient security posture. APT actors inherently attempt multiple intrusions, adapting their approach based on the success or failure of previous attempts. This is an ongoing process that uses indicators to detect new activities, which in turn reveal additional indicators to leverage. Indicators can be classified into three types: atomic indicators, calculated indicators, and behavioral indicators. Utilizing indicators requires a process that is both valid and applicable to the specific problem set. (Eric M. Hutchins  & all 2011: https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf)

A kill chain is a systematic process aimed at identifying and targeting actions against an adversary to achieve desired effects. This process functions as an integrated chain in which any deficiency disrupts the entire sequence. The Intrusion Kill Chain is an expanded version of the kill chain. It can serve as a model for actionable intelligence if defenders align the organization's defense capabilities to the specific processes an adversary commits to when targeting the organization. Through a precise, step-by-step kill chain analysis, an analyst can understand the available information and what types of defensive measures may be implemented.(Eric M. Hutchins  & all 2011)

## h1 Adversarial mindset: a) How would you compare Cyber Kill Chain and ATT&CK Enterprise matrix? Who do you think could benefit from these models?
As I understand it, the Cyber Kill Chain focuses on the different stages of an attack that are important from the attacker’s perspective. It describes the process that attackers follow to achieve their objectives. The ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix, on the other hand, focuses on the various attack techniques and tactics that attackers can use. The usefulness of the models depends on the organization’s needs and situations. I can imagine that, when necessary, a combination of both models could be quite effective.

## h1 Adversarial mindset: b) Pick a security incident and learn about it. Write briefly about it. Point out the concepts of threat actor, exploit, vulnerability and (business) impact. (You can find writeups about security incidents from Darknet Diaries and Krebs)

Darknet Diaries Episode 115: Player Cheater Developer Spy (https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/115/) tells the story of a software developer who created cheats for video games, thus acting as a threat actor. He managed to develop effective tools that gave players an unfair advantage in games, and this vulnerability undermined the fairness and integrity of the game. As a result of the cheating, he attracted attention from both players and game companies, and it is possible that he affected other players' satisfaction and the game's reputation, thereby impacting the entire business. The episode also addresses the ethical and legal challenges faced by the software developer, as well as the consequences that cheat developers can have for both players and game companies.


## h1 Adversarial mindset: c) Install Debian on Virtualbox. Report your work, including the environment (including host OS, the real physical computer used), the steps you took and their results.

I had huge problems to install Virtualbox. At first I realised that I cant use my own computer as its my employer (and yes, I know I should have check this out earlier). So I needed to use one of our old computer but it took time to start it again as it´s been without any use for a very long time.

I tried to install Virtualbox:

but it said that it needs Microsoft Visual C ++ 2019 Redistributable package being installed first. So I tried to install that but

but once again I couldnt install Virtualbox

I tried many times and I ended up feeling tad desperate but I think I will solve this and my next steps are: 1. look at couple of videos about installing Microsoft Visula C ++ 2019 to find out what went wrong and probably ask also from chatgpt and if I still got problems 2. I ask help from my husband before Thursday and tried to get this done. 


# Update: 

Most of the problems was sold out after I started my computer again couple of times and all 
basic Microsoft updates were finally done.  Then I installed first Microsoft Visual C ++ 2019 Redistributable package and then satrted to install Virtual box. I have only few screenshots because I like to use Greenshot ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6b1ae8c-a028-4f66-b859-e285af692dd3) but its not the best option if you dont save your own screenshots right away because they disappear from Greenshot editor if you close your computer.
